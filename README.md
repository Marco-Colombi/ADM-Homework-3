# ADM-Homework-3
### Group 25 Marco Colombi, Mechket Ben Messaoud and Omid Ghamiloo

This is the repository for the Homework 3 of the Group 25.

This repository contains:
1. README.md : a Markdown file that explains the content of our repository.
2. collector.py : a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect your data from the html page (from which we get the urls) and Wikipedia.
3. collector_utils.py : a python file that stores the function we used in collector.py.
4. parser.py : a python file that contains the line of code needed to parse the entire collection of html pages and save those in tsv files.
5. parser_utils.py : a python file that gathers the function we used in parser.py.
6. index.py : a python file that once executed generate the indexes of the Search engines and the urls.json.
7. index_utils.py : a python file that contains the functions we used for creating indexes.
8. main.py: a python file that once executed build up the search engine allowing the user to choose which search engine he wants to use.
9. exercise_4.py: python file that contains the implementation of the algorithm that solves problem 4.
10. main.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook explaines the strategies we adopted solving the homework.

N.b. there is no utils.py as we didn't use functions in more than one of the collector.py, parser.py and index.py files.
